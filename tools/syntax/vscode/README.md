# Martian MRO language support for VSCode

This extension adds basic support for the [martian](https://martian-lang.org)
mro pipeline definition language.

At the moment, only syntax highlighting and formatting are supported.
Formatting support requires the `mro` executable in your `PATH` or in a location
specified in configuration.
