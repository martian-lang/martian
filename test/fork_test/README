Tests for a pipeline with forks.  The pipeline looks like
      ADD_KEY1
         |
      ADD_KEY2
      /      \
ADD_KEY3    ADD_KEY4
      \      /
     MERGE_JSON

Parameters are swept for ADD_KEY2 and ADD_KEY4, so there are a total of 4 forks.

fork_test.json tests normal operation
fail_test.json tests ADD_KEY1 failing with an exception
retry_test.json tests ADD_KEY1 failing with an exception and the passing on second run.
autoretry_pass.json tests that autoretry retries for killed processes.
autoretry_fail.json tests that autoretry does not retry exceptions.
